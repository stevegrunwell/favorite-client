# 5 Things You Can Do to Become Your Agency's Favorite Client

A presentation based on [my Metropreneur article of the same name](http://www.themetropreneur.com/columbus/5-things-you-can-do-to-become-your-agencys-favorite-client/).

> There’s a dirty little secret in the agency world that doesn’t get talked about enough but is absolutely true: awesome clients get special treatment, and crappy clients fall straight to the bottom of the pile. In the same way the barista at your regular coffee shop will occasionally upgrade your drink or a waiter will give more attention to the pleasant tables, the people behind your marketing or development efforts are much more likely to exceed expectations, negotiate on price, or drop everything to help you when an issue arises when you’re a well-liked client. In this session, attendees will gain an insider perspective on building stronger relationships with agencies, freelancers, and other vendors, becoming a better client in the process.
